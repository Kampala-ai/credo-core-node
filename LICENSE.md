Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be determined solely by final and binding arbitration administered, in the English language, by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (&quot;Commercial Rules&quot;) in San Mateo County, California. There shall be one (1) arbitrator agreed to by the parties within twenty (20) days of receipt by respondent of the request for arbitration or in default thereof appointed by the AAA in accordance with its Commercial Rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, non-reviewable, and binding and non-appealable on the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court have jurisdiction. If the arbitrator determines that a party has generally prevailed in the arbitration proceeding, then the arbitrator may, at its sole discretion, award to that party its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to the arbitration, including filing fees, arbitrator compensation, attorneys&#39; fees and legal costs. Furthermore, the arbitrator is not authorized to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party&#39;s actual damages, nor to award damages in excess of the reasonable amount required to conduct the arbitration proceeding (i.e., a party&#39;s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to the arbitration). If more than one (1) arbitration is commenced under this Agreement and any party contends that two (2) or more arbitrations are substantially related and that the issues should be heard in one (1) proceeding, then the arbitrator selected in the first-filed proceeding shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether, in the interests of justice and efficiency, the proceedings should be consolidated before that arbitrator. Related Parties are bound to each other by this arbitration clause, provided that they are subject to the terms of this Agreement or other such related agreement(s). Each Related Party may be joined as an additional party to an arbitration involving other parties under this Agreement or other such related agreement(s). Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may at any time or in any manner disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration proceeding without the express and prior written consent of both parties, from an authorized representative respective to each party, unless to protect or pursue a legal right.
